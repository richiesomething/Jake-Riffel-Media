I am teaching myself HTML/CSS and working to improve and incorperate JS frameworks. 
This is a website I am making for my friend who is a photographer.
It is a work in progress and will update and improve it as I go. 
I know there are some glitches and any tips, tricks, or critiques are welcome!

**NOTE**
I neither own any of the photographs on the website, nor do I intend to make a profit from this. Their sole purpose is to work with images and incorporate them into my work.
